The following scripts and assets are for taking in inputs from controllers.
All controller inputs are currently mapped for windows, I am not sure if it
will work for other platforms. There are 2 versions of the Controller Support
script, one uses the Unity's old input manager system while the other uses the
new input system. PLEASE use one or the other they will not work together!

Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date!

==============================================================================


Old Input system

If you do decide to add more inputs to the script remember to add more 
input axies in Unity's Input system under "Project Settings".

ControllerSupport script:
"Project Name" -> Assets -> where ever you want

InputManager Asset:
"Project Name" -> ProjectSettings

==============================================================================

To use this script, it is very simple! the script will work without you having
to attach the script to any game object. 

Create a reference to the script where you want to detect input:
public ControllerSupport myController;

Simply call the method you want to find out if there is input!
myController.Xbox_LeftStickX(); <--- Example

PLEASE keep in mind that they do not all return the same value.
Joysticks and Triggers return float and will output 0 when there is no input.
Everything else will return a true or false.
