Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import it into the project and add the script,
to any game object in the game scene. This version of the script is using my Absolute Value Attribute,
which can also be downloaded in the custom attributes folder.

IF the script does not work or you do not wish to download the custom inspector simply remove 
"[AbsoluteValue()]" and it will work.

The method "ShowReward" is empty by default, this is due to the limitless different ways to
showcase a loot or reward. Finish the method based on how you want to show the loot or 
reward.
