Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

This script contains many of my custom attributes, please download the:
Custom Attributes folder

The "WeaponSway" script allows the weapon gameobject to rotate and sway when looking around in the scene.

The "GunController" script contains all the functionality of the gun itself! All of the script's functionality
can be accessed outside of the script and can work for any and all platfroms.

The "GunProperties" script is a scriptable object allowing you to create multiple different data containers for
any number of guns in the project.

===============================================================================================================

Using this asset is made very easy! In the prefabs folder add the "Weapon Anchor" prefab to the scene, it should be
attached to your character using the weapon. 

Inside the prefab the game object "Weapon" is where you can place the model of the gun inside the "Mesh Filter" and 
you can add the materials to the gun.

For the Gun Controller script the only things that will need to be changed are the "Aim Fire Position" and the "Weapon Properties" field.
Move the "Weapon" Game Object to the desired position for aiming and copy the position to the "Aim Fire Position" fields.

To Create a Weapon Property, got to the project folder -> Right click -> Create -> Scriptable Objects -> Gun Properties
Name it and fill in your new Gun Properties. Once you are done simply drag your new scriptable object int the the "Weapon Properties"
field.

Using these scripts is also very simple! Fortunetly the only script you will need to referance is the "GunController" script,
the script has selected methods and values that are public. These methods and values are what you will be using to perform the 
various functionalities in the script.

Public Methods:
- SwayInput(float X_Input, float Y_Input) <- This is used for weapon sway script, give the values of the input for looking around.

- AimDownSights(bool AimInput = false) <- ADS, this can be used like a toggle, change the "AimInput" bool.

- Shoot(bool FireInput = false) <- Shooting the gun, change the "AimFireInput" bool.

- ToggleFire() <- Switches between the possible fire selection types.

- Reload() <- Reloads the gun.

- AmmoResupply() <- Refills all the ammo for the gun.

Public values:
- TotalRemainingAmmo, RemainingMagazineAmmo: These 2 variables can be used to show how much ammo is left via UI.
