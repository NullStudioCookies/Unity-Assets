Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import it into the project and add the script,
to any game object in the game scene. This version of the script is using my Absolute Value Attribute,
which can also be downloaded in the custom attributes folder.

IF the script does not work or you do not wish to download the custom inspector simply remove 
"[AbsoluteValue()]", "[ConditionalEnumHide...]" or "[ConditionalHide...]" and it will work.

===================================================================================================

The script for manually controlling the projectile uses the old system for inputs. Feel free to change
the script to suit your project as needed.

If you want to use the homing guidence system you will need to set a target for it to track. Simply 
call the SetTarget() method and asign a game object.
