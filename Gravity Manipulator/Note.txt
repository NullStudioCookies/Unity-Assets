Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

To use this script just simply import it into the project and add the script,
to any game object in the game scene. This version of the script is using my Absolute Value Attribute,
which can also be downloaded in the custom attributes folder.

IF the script does not work or you do not wish to download the custom inspector simply remove 
"[AbsoluteValue()]", "[ConditionalEnumHide...]" or "[ConditionalHide...]" and it will work.

=============================================================================================

These scripts are fairly easy to use and can be dynamicly adjusted in the inspector. The 
"GravityBody" script should be attached to any object that you would want gravity to affect.
As for the "GravityManipulator" script that should be attached to an object other than the one 
with the "GravityBody" script. 

When you attach the "GravityManipulator" script unity will throw an error. Do not worry it is caused
from the script looking for components before all the required components get added.
