The following scripts are for converting all positive number values in the inspector into negative number values. Why?! I'm not sure myself!
Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

NegativeValueAttribute.cs
- This script can be placed anywhere in the project.

NegativeValuePropertyDrawer.cs
- Must be placed in a folder named "Editor".

=============================================================================================

To use this attribute simply put NegativeValue()] / NegativeValuebeside the variable.

NegativeValue()] public int a;
or
NegativeValuepublic int a;
