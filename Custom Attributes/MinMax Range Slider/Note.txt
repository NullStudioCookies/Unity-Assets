The following scripts are for creating a range slider similar to the Unity's "Range" attribute, but this will allow
you to have a minimum value and a maximum value for the range slider. This attribute will only work with Vector2 or Vector2Int.

Please keep in mind that the script and or asset may not be up to date with Unity!

MinMaxRangeAttribute.cs
- This script can be placed anywhere in the project.

MinMaxRangePropertyDrawer.cs
- Must be placed in a folder named "Editor".

=============================================================================================

To use this attribute simply put [MinMaxRange(min value, max value)] / [MinMaxRange] beside the variable.

Floats: [MinMaxRange(min value, max value)] public Vector2 yourVariable;
Ints:[MinMaxRange(min value, max value)] public Vector2Int yourVariable;

PLEASE keep in mind if you choose to just put [MinMaxRange] the default values are 0, and 1.
